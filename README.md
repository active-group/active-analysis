# Active Analytics

A Clojure library containing analytic methods used in our projects. 

#### Dependency information

[Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/)

    [de.active-group/active-analytics "0.1.0"]

[deps.edn](https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli)

    {de.active-group/active-analytics {:mvn/version "0.1.0"}}

## Usage

So far, there are three implemented clustering algorithms:

- [Power iteration clustering (PIC)](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~frank/papers/icml2010-pic-final.pdf): `active-analytics.clustering.pic`
- [k-means clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering): `active-analytics.clustering.k-means`
- [k-medoids clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-medoids) (Lloyd's algorithm): `active-analytics.clustering.k-medoids`

At the moment, the PIC implementation as well as the default k-means
centroid function only support [neanderthal](https://neanderthal.uncomplicate.org/)
as backend. Please follow its [instructions](https://neanderthal.uncomplicate.org/articles/getting_started.html#the-native-library-used-by-neanderthals-native-engine) 
on how to install the needed native Intel MKL library.

The `active-analytics.clustering.silhouettes` namespace contains functions to
measure the quality of clustering results.
