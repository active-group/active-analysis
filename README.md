# Active Analytics

A Clojure library containing analytic methods used in our projects. 

## Usage

So far, there are two (naively) implemented clustering algorithms:

- Power iteration clustering [(PIC)](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~frank/papers/icml2010-pic-final.pdf): `active.analytics.clustering.pic`
- [k-means clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering): `active.analytics.clustering.k-means`
